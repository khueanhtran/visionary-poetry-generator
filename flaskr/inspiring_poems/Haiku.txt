I
The lights are out
The cats are hungry
The room is full of gangsters
II
The dishes are dirty
The icebox is empty
I dream of celery and a compass
III
The roof is upstairs
The window next door
A guitar in the shower
IV
The hours disappear in my room
Where is my blue pistol
The door-god is knocking.
