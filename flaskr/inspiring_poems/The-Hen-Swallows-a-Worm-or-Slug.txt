I use a stickto dig, to find for her what she’s shown menear the roots, at the edge of a step—stickyslug on the underside of a hosta’s leaf.How complicated she is and how resigned.Between her beak and my outstretched hand,the worm’s writhing. Then the long slick goingdown. It fills the throat, like all that’s swallowed.        Her head chucks it back,        for the worm again dark.        The hen’s pupil dilates.        She wends and follows.Her queries, sighs, low gurgles, the hasteningclick of her nails on pavement then hungryagain into the grass. Grubs are largerthan pale yellow larvae I prize from insidechestnuts. These mucousy blind wanderersshe eats right from my palm. Nevertheless I amrepulsed by my husband’s embrace. I turnnow from his thick belly, breasts, his interests.A body I had clambered over, loved.I scrabble, struggle. I cover myself.        Another sticky truth dug up        that I must re-bury—        sorry on hands and knees,        hungry and wary.
