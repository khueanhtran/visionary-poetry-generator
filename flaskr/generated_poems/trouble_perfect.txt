shall i turn and take comfortless snow within my arms? press birds near stars which come not, press lips to fill that shudders not yet breaks?
shall i break your rest, becoming, eager? completes infinite 's rest now... nay, song 's the loveliest: yet were you lost, what rapture could i take from song?
shall i turn and take comfortless snow within my arms? press birds to lips that trouble perfect, press eyelids to secret whatever goes not but carcasses?
shall i turn and take comfortless sound within my arms? press lines to lips that answer not, press breaks to flesh that rises not yet breaks?
here my foam is near the gesture sleeping yet to break, so my traffic strives toward my space, waiting for song 's sky?
