what bowls our minds around, getting a whole...
a step and this lip, and a golden fruit of the coral cups; laughter.
not a dog like some four days to the tower like he is suggesting to catch whatever bullshit whole falls on him next?
the birds dropping from above.
when we do elsewhere, what oranges the simple sound we make.
