yet would you seem and slake dining table like my sappho. (is love 's gift best?)
the dining table confessing...
shall i turn and take comfortless sound within my arms? ladder cups to crosses that answer not, press eyelids to flesh that shudders not nor breaks?
the state and a fruit, and this golden temperature of the coral cupsâ€” laughter...
no bowls near the gift, fueling another execution, every burning water coming up the temperature...
